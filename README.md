App Class is consider as Wrapper Class, you can inject to it any class you want to use it in your app.

new modification, may cause narrow down the usage of the App class, but it's more clear and easy to use.
because App class may i use it for something else, than Container, may previous branch which i use App::container() more generic

That is my opinion, but i'm not sure if it's right or wrong, i'm still learning.
